## Project Overview <a name="projectoverview"></a>

* This project was made so that the user could create an employment database that they could update using a CLI all while using mainly mysql and node.js.

## Execution
### Use the Github Link above:
> First create the database in mysql using the schema and seed files that are provided in the directory.
> Next ensure your database information matches that of what is in the server.js file.
![NewNote](./assets/images/Connection_Info.png)
> After you can run an npm install to get all the necessary node modules onto your local system directory.
> Lastly you can run the file by going into your preferred CLI and running the server.js file with node. (If you get a connection as id .. you're good to go)
